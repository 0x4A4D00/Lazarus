This folder contains simple demonstration projects for the most important 
LCL components.

Both rad ("rapid application development") and runtime folders contain the
same project for each component. In the rad folder the forms used are created 
 using the Lazarus form designer while the forms in the "runtime" folder are 
 created by code at runtime.
